# Don't String Me Along 

Don't String Me Along is a coding challenge that is sometimes great and sometimes makes you wish you never met.

## Description

In this exercise you must will solve a number of challenges for dealing with manipulating and searching strings in various ways.

## Objectives

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub profile and clone to your local machine.

2. Write a function that finds the missing numbers when given a string of numbers. For example, if given the string `"9899100101103104105"` your function will return an array with the values of `[2, 6, 7]`. You are looking for numbers between `0 - 9`.

3. Write a function that takes a string of two words as input such as a name and swaps the order of the words with a comma separating the two words. Ex. "Jay Won" => "Won, Jay".

4. Write a function that takes 2 strings as input and tests if the first string can be found in a circular variation of the second string. it should return a Boolean value.

5. Write a function that takes a single word as input and tests if it is a palindrome (ex. racecar), the same forwards as backwards.

### BONUS ROUND
- Objective #2
  
  Your function is able to parse a string and figure out what the range is before finding what's missing. If given  `"9899100101103104105"`, it will return the value of `[102]` since it seems like the string is a collection of numbers  between `98 to 105`.
  
- Objective #3

  Bonus: Use RegEx to solve this problem.
  
- Objective #5

  Bonus: Test for the existence of any palindromes in a word
